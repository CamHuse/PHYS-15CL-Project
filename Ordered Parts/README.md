This file houses 3D models for all of the parts we ordered and used to make the inverted pendulum

- Threaded Rotary Shaft: this was the primary rotary shaft housed in the Hub. The threads let it connect to the T-Bracket.
- CUI_Device: this was the encoder used to detect the angle of the inverted pendulum.
- Hub Pad: this was the main cart that connected to the rail and the pulley system. The hub connected to this part so it could be moved.
- MS085: This is the limit switch. This was used to tell the inverted pendulum where the ends of the rail where and to stop the cart from being run off of the rail.
- V-Slot Belt Driven Actuator: This is a model of the rail system without any of the inverted pendulum parts attached to it.
