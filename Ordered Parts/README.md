# Inverted Pendulum Ordered Parts

This repository contains 3D models for components used in our inverted pendulum project.

### Components:

- **Threaded Rotary Shaft:** Primary rotary shaft integrated into the Hub, featuring threads for connection to the T-Bracket.

- **CUI_Device:** Encoder used to measure the angle of the inverted pendulum.

- **Hub Pad:** Main cart connecting to the rail and pulley system, with the hub attaching for movement.

- **MS085 (Limit Switch):** Used to detect the ends of the rail and prevent the cart from running off.

- **V-Slot Belt Driven Actuator:** Model of the rail system without attached inverted pendulum components.
