This folder contains all the 3D models for parts used to assemble the inverted pendulum. The parts are as follows:

- **Ball Bearing Holder**: Secures the ball bearing in place on the Hub.
- **Bracket Rail Connector**: Attaches the Switch Bracket to the rail.
- **Hub**: Houses the encoder, rotary shaft, and ball bearings needed for the inverted pendulum. The Hub connects to the cart, allowing the entire inverted pendulum system to move.
- **Spacer**: A spacer was needed to correctly assemble the pulley system, as the one that was ordered was too small.
- **Switch Bracket**: Houses the limit switches and connects them to the rail.
- **T-Bracket**: Connects the rotary shaft to the main inverted pendulum rod.
