This folder houses all of the 3D printed parts that were used to assemble the inverted pendulum. 

- Ball Bearing Holder: Kept the ball bearing in place on the hub
- Bracket Rail Connector: Attached the Switch Bracket to the rail
- Hub: Housed the encoder, rotary shaft, and ball bearing need for the inverted pendulum. Also connected all of this to the cart
- Spacer: needed a spacer to correctly assemble the pulley system, and the one that was ordered was too small.
- Switch Bracket: housed the limit switches and was what connected them to the rail.
- T-Bracket: connected the rotary shaft to thh main inverted pendulum rod.
