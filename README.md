## Assembly Instructions:

1. Order the necessary parts.
2. Print the final version of the 3D models.
3. Construct the base rail system.
4. Attach the 3D printed parts to the moving cart and install the endstop switches.
5. Attach the encoder, ball bearings, and pendulum rod to the cart.
6. Wire the encoder and endstop switches to the Arduino as described in the code.
7. Wire the stepper motor controller to the Arduino as described in the code.
8. Wire the 24V DC supply to the stepper motor controller and connect the 4 stepper wires.
9. Run the Arduino Mega.
