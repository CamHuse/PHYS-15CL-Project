# Inverted Pendulum

This GitHub directory outlines the project that Eliott Schaffer, Jeremy Lauro, and Cameron Huse worked on for PHYS 15C at UCSB in the Spring Quarter of 2024. 

Each folder describes a different aspect of the project, and files significant to that part are contained along with specific documentation.

Assembely of the system is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>Order the neccisary parts</li>
  <li>Print the final version 3D Modelsli>
  <li>Construct the base rail system</li>
  <li>Attach the 3D printed parts to the moving cart and for the endstop switches</li>
  <li>Attach encoder, ball bearings and pendulum rod to the cart</li>
  <li>Wire encoder and endstop switches to aurdino as described in the code</li>
  <li>Wire stepper motor controller to arduino as described in the code</li>
  <li>Wire 24V DC supply to stepper motor controller and the 4 stepper wires</li>
  <li>Run the Arduino Mega</li>
</ol>
